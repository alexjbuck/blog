I like to build things, I like to fly tactical helicopters, and I like solving thorny technical problems for people.

## Some things I've built

### [BadMax](https://github.com/alexjbuck/badmax) (deployed at [https://badmax.dso.mil/](https://badmax.dso.mil/))
A tool for building Air Plan documents from ashore.

When I realized that my peers on the Carrier Airwing Staff were building Air Plan documents by drawing lines in PowerPoint to recreate the format generated by the ADMACS program onboard the aircraft carrier I knew I needed to do something about it.

### [Cronus](https://github.com/alexjbuck/cronus)
A lightweight tool to cleanly archive post-mission recorded data to S3 storage (AWS Snowball Edge) or local hard drive location.

Most tactical units that I've seen, both in service and since transitioning to a contractor role, are really bad at capturing their mission data and using it to build a bigger picture of their environment and their performance over time. 
Building a smooth workflow (that operators will actually use) for just simply saving any data generated by their tactical systems is a simple but necessary step.

### [PmaParser](https://github.com/alexjbuck/pmaparser)
A command line tool for batch processing Post Mission Analysis files from the MH-60R.

The platform in my aviation community would produce all sorts of recorded information. Much of it was only accessible via click-ops graphical user interfaces. This tooling was unable to support queries against a batch of missions. As a first step in unlocking the Post Mission Analysis data file, this parser dumps the contents into standardized formats (e.g. CSV) instead of the native custom binary packed data format. 

### [WaveBreaker](https://github.com/alexjbuck/wavebreaker)
A tool for planning JDAM impact points to cover the area of uncertainty from a moving, unobserved target.

During my participation in the USAF Bravo Hackathon 01, while the focus was on building machine learning systems with some classified data sources, I realized there was an interesting tactical challenge that could be addressed by a good application of some plain old maths plus a good user interface.
I decided to break with the pack and build this tool that could be loaded onto aircrew tablets as is and be used to make an impact.

## Some things I'm okay at

I dabble mostly with Python and Rust, and mostly in the context of data processing, parsing, and storage.

I'm familiar with the Postgres database ecosystem.

Every now and again I'll work into the Next.js ecosystem for some integration, but I know that's not really my swimlane.

I'm intimately comfortable on the linux terminal. I've spent many an hour ssh'd into a remote server building and deploying code.
