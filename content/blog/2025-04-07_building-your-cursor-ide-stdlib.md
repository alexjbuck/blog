In the rapidly evolving landscape of AI-powered development tools, Cursor IDE stands out with its unique ability to learn and adapt to your codebase. This post explores how to leverage Cursor's `.cursor/rules` system to build your own "stdlib" - a standard library of knowledge that makes your AI assistant smarter and more effective over time.

## What is Cursor?

Cursor is not just another IDE - it's an AI-first development environment that fundamentally changes how we write code. At its core, Cursor offers:

- üí° Intelligent Code Completion that understands context
- üîç Deep understanding of your entire codebase
- ü§ù Natural language interaction for coding tasks
- üìö Automatic documentation generation
- üß† Self-learning capabilities through rules

What sets Cursor apart is its ability to operate in different modes:

1. **Ask Mode**: User-initiated queries for explanations, refactoring, or problem-solving
2. **Manual Mode**: Traditional coding with AI assistance on demand
3. **Agent Mode** (‚åòI): Proactive AI that suggests improvements and learns from your codebase

## Understanding Cursor Rules

The heart of Cursor's learning capability lies in its `.cursor/rules` system. Think of it as your AI's personal knowledge base - a collection of guidelines, patterns, and best practices specific to your project.

### Rule Types

Cursor rules come in four flavors:

1. **Auto-attached Rules**
   - Triggered automatically based on file patterns
   - Example: Rules for `*.js`, `*.toml`, or `content/*.md` files
   - Applied whenever matching files are being worked with

2. **Agent-requested Rules**
   - Used contextually when relevant
   - The Cursor agent reads rule descriptions to decide when to apply them
   - Helps maintain consistency across similar scenarios

3. **Always Rules**
   - Global rules applied to every interaction
   - Perfect for project-wide conventions and standards

4. **Manual Rules**
   - Explicitly referenced in agent chat or other rules
   - Used for specific scenarios or complex workflows

### Anatomy of a Rule

A Cursor rule is a Markdown file (`.mdc`) with a specific structure:

```yaml
---
description: Clear purpose of the rule
globs: ["*.ts", "*.tsx"]
type: auto_attached
---
# Rule Title

## Context
Background information about what the rule addresses

## Guidelines
Specific instructions for the AI to follow

## Examples
Concrete code samples showing the rule in action
```

## The Power of Self-Learning

What makes Cursor's rule system truly powerful is its ability to evolve with your project. The self-learning process follows a simple cycle:

1. üîç **Pattern Recognition**: Identify common issues or patterns
2. üìù **Documentation**: Record solutions and best practices
3. üèóÔ∏è **Rule Creation**: Formalize knowledge into rules
4. üîÑ **Refinement**: Apply, test, and improve rules over time

### Error Analysis Framework

When encountering issues, Cursor can help build new rules using this framework:

1. Identify the root cause of the error
2. Document the incorrect approach that led to it
3. Record the correct solution
4. Create or update rules to prevent similar issues

Common rule categories include:
- Type system errors
- Integration issues
- Performance patterns
- Dependency management
- Project-specific conventions

## Getting Started with Rules

Ready to build your own stdlib? Here's how to begin:

1. Install Cursor IDE from [cursor.sh](https://cursor.sh)
2. Create a `.cursor/rules` directory in your project
3. Add your first rule based on a common pattern or issue
4. Let the system grow organically as you work

Start small - create rules for patterns you encounter frequently. Over time, your rule collection will grow into a comprehensive knowledge base that makes your development process more efficient and consistent.

## Resources

To learn more about Cursor and rules:

- [Cursor IDE Website](https://cursor.sh)
- [Official Documentation](https://docs.cursor.com/get-started/welcome)
- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/getcursor/cursor)
- [Community Forum](https://forum.cursor.com/)

Keep an eye out for the upcoming Spear AI baseline `.cursor/rules` collection, which will provide a solid foundation for building your own rule system.

## Conclusion

Cursor's rule system represents a significant step forward in AI-assisted development. By building your own stdlib through rules, you're not just documenting patterns - you're creating a living knowledge base that makes your AI assistant smarter and more effective with each interaction.

Remember: start small with rules and let them grow naturally as you encounter new patterns and challenges. The power of Cursor lies not just in its AI capabilities, but in its ability to learn and adapt to your specific needs through the rule system.

Happy coding!
